## Git Workflow Rules

1. **Branching Strategy:**
    - Each developer should work on their own development branch (e.g. kl_dev == kilian lehn development branch).
    - The `main` branch should only be updated through pull requests.
    - Pull requests to the `main` branch require a review before being merged.
    - Delete feature branches once they are merged into `main`.

2. **Commit Messages:**
    - Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes made.
    - Use the imperative mood, e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature".

3. **Conflict Resolution:**
    - Resolve merge conflicts in your development branch before submitting a pull request.
    - Keep your branch updated with the latest changes from `main` to minimize conflicts.

4. **Code Review:**
    - Actively participate in code review processes.
    - Reviewers should ensure code quality, functionality, and adherence to design principles.
