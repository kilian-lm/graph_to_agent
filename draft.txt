what i mean server side is that the nodes and edges should be saved by .json in the session with a buuton in the uicalled "agent setup o.k." and than a textfield where to user can formulate the problem space that should be passed to the created agents. save via .py bq client to big query the way i already designed the connection, provide fruthermore a dropdown for the user, where the user can than select from all agent-problemspace setup and reload them and trigger them to start the communication. Assume that i already set up service account and gcp project : class Solver:

You are requesting a web application with the following features:

Nodes and edges represented on a UI (I assume as a graphical representation of problem space).
An "Agent Setup O.K." button that saves these nodes and edges as a .json in the session.
A text field for users to define the problem space.
Capability to save the problem space and agent setup to BigQuery using Python.
A dropdown for users to select and reload previously saved agent-problem space setups and then start agent communication.
The provided Python code describes how to model problem spaces using different reasoning agents and save their interactions.

Below, I'll outline a basic Flask-based web application for the described requirements. Note that this will be a blueprint and will need further expansion and testing:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify, session
from google.cloud import bigquery
import json
import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'some_secret_key'

# Initialize BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Initialize Solver class
solver = Solver(openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", url="YOUR_OPENAI_URL")


@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')


@app.route('/save_to_session', methods=['POST'])
def save_to_session():
    data = request.json
    session['nodes_edges'] = data['nodes_edges']
    return jsonify({"message": "Saved to session"})


@app.route('/model_problem_space', methods=['POST'])
def model_problem_space():
    problem_description = request.form.get('problem_description')
    responses = solver.model_problem_spaces(problem_description)
    return jsonify(responses)


@app.route('/save_to_bigquery', methods=['POST'])
def save_to_bigquery():
    data = request.json
    table_id = "your_project_id.your_dataset_id.your_table_id"

    rows_to_insert = [
        {
            u"timestamp": datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
            u"data": json.dumps(data),
        },
    ]

    errors = client.insert_rows_json(table_id, rows_to_insert)
    if errors == []:
        return jsonify({"message": "Saved to BigQuery successfully"})
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": f"Encountered errors: {errors}"})


@app.route('/get_saved_setups', methods=['GET'])
def get_saved_setups():
    # Fetch saved setups from BigQuery
    query = """
    SELECT timestamp, data
    FROM `your_project_id.your_dataset_id.your_table_id`
    """
    results = client.query(query).result()
    setups = [{"timestamp": row.timestamp, "data": json.loads(row.data)} for row in results]

    return jsonify(setups)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
For the frontend, you'll have an index.html with the following blueprint:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Agent Setup</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Visualization of nodes and edges -->
    <div id="visualization"></div>

    <button id="saveSession">Agent Setup O.K.</button>
    <textarea id="problemDescription" placeholder="Formulate the problem space"></textarea>
    <button id="modelProblemSpace">Model Problem Space</button>

    <select id="savedSetupsDropdown">
        <!-- Options fetched from BigQuery -->
    </select>
    <button id="loadSetup">Load Setup</button>
    <button id="triggerStart">Start Communication</button>

    <!-- JavaScript to handle button clicks and AJAX calls -->

</body>
</html>
This is a very basic representation of the setup you require. The frontend part especially requires more detail, like integrating a library to display nodes and edges, handling events, etc. This code also assumes you have properly set up Flask, the Google Cloud SDK, and other required libraries.

Remember to handle exceptions, add security measures, and further split and modularize the code for clarity and maintainability before moving it to production.
