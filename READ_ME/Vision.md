## Abstract

Let's enumerate in one section what this is all about (yes, we do repeat Personal Knowledge Library (PKL) definition on
purpose):

- **Overarching Goal**: A social-network consisting of Knowledge Graphs in the form of Personal Knowledge Libraries (
  PKL)
- **Public Section of Personal Knowledge Library (PKL)** as a way to build up knowledge adhering to "standing on the
  shoulders of giants"
- **Git-Approach to Personal Knowledge Library (PKL)** adheres to "cross-validation" principles, by forking out,
  reassessing and making a pull-request/ merge back in the original Personal Knowledge Library (PKL)
- By visualizing the intellectual trajectories of thought and discovery in the Public Section of the Personal Knowledge
  Library (PKL), we enable some kind of "reproducibility"
- Use The Wire-Box [link] or Augmented Argumentation via Agent Interactions to encapsulate expert knowledge and an
  infinite universe of further options
- Plot and re-use a flawed reward system

## The Problem

Today's "infinite scroll"/"slot-machine"⁰ presents content—whether posts, images, or videos—in a seemingly endless,
disconnected stream. This disconnect impedes users from delving into interconnected topics, depriving them of a cohesive
understanding. Furthermore most of these platforms and even more scientific ones e.g. nature journal, are triggered by
the rewards of quick wins & news coverage¹. Such superficial and short-lived scrolling news contrasts sharply with
Knowledge Graphs, where interconnected pathways usher users to deeper insights² and to track the history & performance
of news-commits (think of "from-event-to-release" and "interaction" KPIs as cross-validation approaches what the
news-commit is aimed at [identify targeting patterns -- reusing the flawed reward system]).

## Solution Pillars

- **Personal Knowledge Libraries (PKL)**

Example: Imagine Instagram's chronological photo feed, but instead of photos, you have nodes representing key thoughts,
ideas, or memories. Or consider LinkedIn , where connections don't just represent professional relationships, but
conceptual links between ideas. In essence, PKL isn’t just another social media platform—it's a fusion that amalgamates
the essence of Instagram's visual storytelling, Twitter's/ X's bite-sized thoughts, LinkedIn's professional sharing, and
even Tinder's interactive engagement, all aimed at charting the growth of a person's intellectual journey³. But NOT
based on scrolling and swiping thus enhancing our endorphin and dopamine roller coaster but consisting of wandering or
rather strolling in a considered manner the graph-edges.

## Immediate Goals

One immediate goal is to design a platform of a knowledge graph generation (Simple maintainable pipeline for content (
blobs) to graph with integrated modules 'Time-Stamped Content Evolution Graphs ' & 'Augmented Argumentation via Agent
Interactions' see below) with the possibility to segregate between private repo and public repo, enabling users to
control what they share.

## Future Vision

Pair PKL with virtual reality. Visualize a personal 3D knowledge universe weaving an immersive narrative of evolving
thoughts. Like navigating a cerebral museum, every node and connection breathes life into the intellectual universe⁴ and
could help others on similar problems and stages of life.

### Time-Stamped Content Evolution Graphs

Example: Both A Dangerous Game⁶ and Arrival⁷ challenge conventional understandings of time as a fixed, linear
progression. Whereas Dürrenmatt explores the re-evaluation of past events as a means of interrogating the present,
Arrival presents a narrative in which the future can be perceived and interacted with in the present moment. These works
collectively suggest a more fluid, interconnected conception of time, which in turn invites a re-evaluation of our own
understandings and experiences of temporality. Similarly, consider how politicians’ promises and speeches often shift
with context and audience, or how 'Fake News' muddies our information streams. The challenges of discerning fact from
fiction and tracing the evolution of statements becomes daunting⁸.

Enter our git-versioned (thanks Linus Torvalds who would never use LinkedIn I guess :D) content graph universe. Instead
of scrutinizing right from wrong, this system records 'commits'—versions of content from specific sources at specified
times. Users can trace the evolution of narratives, spot inconsistencies, or recognize recurring patterns⁹ (e.g.
trageting patterns like mentioned in the intro). Want a deeper dive? Fork a branch, revisit a statement’s version, and
layer it with your insights or perspectives into your PKL or cluster it into an agent-pool (see below).

Current Status: MVP in Development.

### The Wire-Box or Augmented Argumentation via Agent Interactions

Following our git-versioned content graphs, visualize a box of wires, akin to the neural connections in our brain. These
are the edges, the links, the pathways of thoughts users can customize¹⁰. Users can segment their thought processes,
encapsulate them within agents, and interlink them¹¹. For instance, if you've been tracking a politician's statements on
climate change, you could have an agent encapsulating all related environmental data, another with socio-economic
implications, and another with global political reactions.

These agents, then, aren't just isolated data points—they're interconnected facets of your understanding. They can
interact, validate, or even challenge each other based on the connections you've made, mimicking the internal dialogues
we often have when trying to understand complex topics.

#### Why the Wire-Box

Heads-Up: We wrote this part of the proposal 02.11.2023 and only just realized that this is exactly the Vision of
OpenAI (or what is known up to now 00:31:40 [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk))

We could say we designed the Wire-Box because we had a dream that non-technical people could use the power of
graph-based agent behavior too. But that would be a lie. We created it because we want to use expert knowledge. For
example experts of empathy, in psychology, in creativity, in physics, in chemistry, in medicine, in any kind of
expertise field. But the point is, if they don't know how to use custom instruction or how to layer agents and if they
don't have any idea how to use graphs at all in the connection with agents, then we are missing an opportunity. Because
we're sure that those expert fields left their traces in the language corpus that GPT uses. Now if the experts manage to
unlock this knowledge in a meaningful way, we're at this sub-moduls goal. So we would suggest that all these experts put
themselves in the position of seeing themselves as keys. They are for me, for us, for the society, the keys to unlock
the right kind of wiring between the agents, the right kind of layering of the agents in order to get a robust,
reliable, reproducible outcome. So this is our true reason for the Wire-Box.

#### Business-Model for Sub-Module Wire-Box

The following business-model is in line with the Revenue-Sharing OpenAI (same reference as
above [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk)) is teasing, just that our approach would also focus on
integrating OS llms with the ability of agent behaviour so as to give the user a chance for assessing which agents of
which llms are best for the use case (different attention heads etc.).

**Business-Model**

**Description:**

- Agent/Agent Pool Creation: Users (U) initiate the process by creating agents or agent pools based on their (expert)
  knowledge.
- Saving to Database: Once an agent or agent pool is created, the System (S) saves this information in a Database (DB).
  This step ensures that all agent data and configurations are securely stored and managed (sorry for the MVP it's a
  save to a DWH because of cost implications).
- Deployment and Layering: Users have the ability to deploy, redeploy, or layer their agents. This means they can
  initiate the agent, make modifications, or combine it with other agents or pools to enhance its capabilities or
  efficiency. (Not in MVP)
- Status Update and Validation: As agents are deployed or modified, the System updates their status in the Database.
  Concurrently, there's an ongoing validation process where the System continually validates and optimizes the
  connections and interactions between agents. This loop represents the process of continuous improvement and
  optimization of the agents. (Not in MVP)
- Renting Out Robust Agents: Once agents are deemed robust and efficient through the validation process, the System (
  representing the Company, C) rents them out. This implies that other entities or customers can use these
  well-developed agents, likely for a fee. (Not in MVP)
- Maintenance and Experimentation: While the Company is responsible for the maintenance of these agents, ensuring they
  run smoothly and effectively, Users are given the opportunity to experiment with these agents in a sandbox
  environment. This environment allows Users to test and experiment without affecting the live, operational versions of
  the agents.
- Feedback Loop with Experts: Experts (E), who might be more advanced users or specialists in the field, use these
  agents and provide feedback and suggestions for improvements to the System. This feedback is crucial for the ongoing
  development and refinement of the agents. (Not in MVP)

## Conclusion

The game design of Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding, Kojima Productions, recognizes the profound significance of human
connections⁵. This brought us to write the proposal. In a world characterized by isolation, the game symbolizes the deep
human need to establish and nurture connections (in a healthy way, not the flawed systems we're deriving endorphin and
dopamine from like Instagram / X / YouTube / Tinder / LinkedIn). Similarly, PKL seeks to create bridges between isolated
knowledge nodes, facilitating intellectual interactions and growth (if you don't know the game, check out 00:22:14 - 00:
24:56 && 00:26:59 - 00:28:13 in order to understand the reward
system [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFtYXoOowKQ&ab_channel=Gingy)). This paired with the gaining speed of the
usage of knowledge graphs and the crumbling of language barriers (we do mean all kind of languages as we can now use
LLMs to translate not only words but meaning), makes the time feel as right as it could be to submit this proposal to
the WWW.
